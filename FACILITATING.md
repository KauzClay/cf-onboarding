## Facilitating Onboarding Week (OSS Track)

### Overview
Onboarding Week exists to provide Cloud Foundry engineers dedicated time to explore the platform in a self-paced learning environment.

It has also been used by Labs engineers on the beach to gain a deeper understanding of the platform they use for client projects.

Either way, the idea is to give people who want more experience with CF the space to work through common problems alongside someone who has the same questions as they do, coming away with knowledge drawn from figuring something out themselves (something that is often lacking when paired an experienced dev).

Whether you are with CF or with Labs, Onboarding Week is intended to be a **facilitated** experience. We want participants to get "productively lost" together, not wander in aimless hair-tearing frustration. If you want to give it a try, but don't have a facilitator, join the [#cf-onboarding-week](https://pivotal.slack.com/messages/cf-onboarding-week/) Slack channel to ask if someone in another office is available to be a remote guide.

### Preparation Suggestions
* Allocate participants for the week.
* Designate workstation(s).
* Provide one "floater" laptop per pair to facilitate independent docs reading.
* Create and populate *private* Tracker Project(s). Invite participants.
* [Request GCP IAAS project(s)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJ31997Zma1WtLcCtswiysCFWOG5MXNmlYCpJsiYgdG9kKnA/viewform). Once they're created, add participants as Owners.

### Communication Suggestions
* **Morning Standup:** to review how the week is going / answer questions.
* **After-lunch pow-wow:** more review and questions (for some groups this is indispensable, for others it's less necessary).
* **Second Afternoon Check-in:** Have a facilitator stop by the participants' workstations again later in the afternoon (around 4pm) to see if they have any additional questions.
* **+/âˆ†s ("plus deltas"):** An end-of-day email to everyone involved in the week (e.g. onboarders, managers, interested third parties) reviewing what went well and what they would have liked to change about the day. This is an opportunity to reflect and give prompt feedback on how the week is going (it's also something that CF NYC teams do for real).
* **Group Slack:** Start a message thread to share resources and post reminders (a channel is probably overkill).
* **Retro:** What Pivotal experience could be complete without a retro? Order goodies and treat it like a celebration.

### Structure Suggestions
* If you have more than one pair doing this at once (which is a better experience for all involved if you can swing it), try having them rotate after lunch instead of in the morning. This helps with context retention, knowledge sharing, and getting the day started promptly (instead of settling in with a new pair).
* Don't load all modules at once at the beginning of the week. Start with stories to get their environment set up, then add others as-needed in response to Onboarder questions and requests.
* If they find the last hour or so of the day hard to get though (this is a really draining week for Onboarders) encourage them to use it in whichever way will be most productive. This could mean separating from their pair to read docs, if that's what they need.
* Thursday and Friday are good days for the more free-form exploratory modules that they might not have been confident enough to tackle at the beginning of the week.

### Daily Theme Suggestions
* Be conscious of your pair's needs. Support one another. Teach one another.
* When you learn something new, tell your pair. Get in the habit of being honest about ignorance and progress.
* Learn to be comfortable with the idea of breaking something. If you're afraid to break your environment, you'll have a harder time learning and exploring.
* This is your week. Pursue the topics that interest you.
* How will you apply what you've learned this week to the future?
