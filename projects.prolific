Create a Redis BOSH Release

### What?
Okay, the training wheels are coming **off**. This BOSH Release is gonna be you + the same docs anyone else uses ("whhaaaaaat?" "I know, they grow up so fast!"). But first, a little preamble:

A BOSH release is a versioned collection of configuration properties, configuration templates, start up scripts, source code, binary artifacts, and anything else required to *build and deploy software in a reproducible way*. Each BOSH VM starts with a [stemcell](http://bosh.io/docs/stemcell.html), and then has utility added to it in the form of releases. Your Redis release might include start-up and shutdown scripts for the redis-server, a tarball with Redis source code obtained from the Redis official website, and configuration properties allowing cluster operators to alter that Redis configuration.

### How?
Follow [these instructions](http://bosh.io/docs/create-release.html) and refer to [this MySQL release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release) as an example. If you get totally stuck, refer to this [community-created Redis release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/redis-boshrelease).

### Expected Result
A BOSH release that facilitates the use of Redis by a CF deployed app.

Create a Concourse resource

### What?
As we've seen, a [Concourse resource](http://concourse.ci/concepts.html#resources) can be checked for new versions, used as a trigger when new versions are found, pulled down at a specific version, and pushed up idempotently to create new versions.

There's a whole host of [system resource types](https://concourse.ci/resource-types.html) available, but they don't cover every potential use case. It won't be too long till you'll need to create one of your very own.

### How?
Use the **[Concourse documentation](https://concourse.ci/implementing-resources.html)** to create your own resource. Make liberal use of resource repos on Github to guide you on your path. Your steps will broadly be:

1. Write check / in / out scripts that make sense for your resource.
1. Package in a Docker container and publish to the docker registry.
1. Configure your pipeline to include your new resource type, create an instance of that resource type, and consume that resource.
1. Lots of debugging, with poor feedback mechanisms.

**Debugging Note:** write errors to `stderr` because `stdout` must be only a JSON object.

### Expected Result
A resource that can be used as a trigger for a job in your pipeline. To date, my favorite combinations of resources/tasks have been:
* an XKCD notifier
* a bot that spammed a Slack channel with vocabulary from a Danish thesaurus

Let's get creative!
